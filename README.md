# Solution for the [Queens-Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)

Solves the queens problem (how to place the max number of queens on a
chessboard of size N).

* First you need to install `sbt` (e.g. with `asdf`)
* Then you can compile (`sbt compile`) and test (`sbt test`) it
* And last you can run (`sbt "run 3"`) it on a board of size N (N >= 3)

The algorithm looks for the max number of queens to put on a chess board
of size N and then calculates the number of solutions.

The solution is based on the [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/N-queens_problem#Scala).

To see the solutions you need to set the log-level (in
`./src/main/resources/logback.xml`) to `info`.
